# React Jobs Search

For this project, you will build a mini job-search interface using the Findwork API to retrieve the most relevant remote developer job listings in several different categories of your choosing.

## Requirements

Create your React application using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project). The application should have tab-style navigation and allow a user to select a category to see job listings in that category. You should have a loading indicator for the UI while the data is being fetched, and your user should have an option to get a random remote job from the API.

You should handle null or missing values gracefully -- that is, your UI should not look broken if data is missing.

Your application must be styled. You might want to use a CSS library to help with styling, but you don't have to.

Your application must be deployed to Netlify. üöÄ Please include a URL for your live application in your project README.

### Tab Navigation

Job categories are shown on tabs. You'll hard-code several categories that you find interesting (how many is up to you, but at least 3). Your user can click on a tab to see jobs in that category, corresponding to a keyword search in the [FindWork API](https://findwork.dev/developers/). For example, if you have a "React" tab, when that is selected, you will show job listings that result from making a request to `https://findwork.dev/api/jobs/?remote=true&search=react&sort_by=relevance`. Notice the query params.

Your tabs can be positioned vertically (like in the wireframe) or horizontally. When a category is selected, it should be highlighted somehow in the UI.

The options in tab navigation correspond to different keyword searches. You should decide what the categories are and hard-code them in your app.

### FindWork API

Go to the [FindWork API](https://findwork.dev/developers/) and sign up for free access to their developer portal. The [documentation page](https://findwork.dev/developers/) will walk you through how to use the API. You will need to get an API key to make requests. It is available on the [documentation page](https://findwork.dev/developers/); just read the documentation to find the link.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you get CORS errors, use this proxy API instead: `https://proxy-findwork-api.glitch.me`. You can use that in your requests in place of `https://findwork.dev`.

Requests will need to include a header that contains the API key, like this:

```js
axios.get(apiURL, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Token your-api-key-goes-here`
  }
}
).then(...)
```

When a user selects a category, your app will make a request to the FindWork API to get job listings in that category. You should show at least the first 5 or 6 listings that the API returns. Note that the API does not allow you to set a limit on the number of responses, so you'll have to do this in JavaScript.

#### A word about best practices with API Keys üîë üîí

You should not commit API keys to version control. In order to avoid doing this, we store sensitive data, like credentials, in environment variables that are available to the application at runtime but are not actually in the application code. This usually involves having a file that is excluded from version control called `.env` or `.env.local` that contains the environment variables your application needs to run in your local development environment. Those environment variables would then also be set in your production environment.

Vite has documentation [for including environment variables](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables).

You can create a `.env` file at your project root, and put your API Key in it like this:

```env
VITE_FINDWORK_API_KEY=my-api-key-12345678
```

In your React code:

```js
axios.get(apiURL, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Token ${import.meta.env.VITE_FINDWORK_API_KEY}`
  }
}
).then(...)
```

To exclude your .env file from version control, [make sure you have a `.gitignore` file](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files) that contains the name of the file you want to exclude (`.env`).

### Loading Indicator üåÄ

Your UI should show some kind of [progress indicator](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-progress/), like a [spinner](https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/), an [animation](https://www.framer.com/motion/examples), a [loading skeleton](https://github.com/dvtng/react-loading-skeleton), or something else instead of a blank page while data is being requested from the API. You don't _have_ to use any of those libraries -- they are provided to give you some ideas -- but you do have to implement some kind of loading state and UI indication that data is being fetched.

### Show a Random Job

Your application should allow your user to get a random job.

[Amelia Wattenberger](https://wattenberger.com/)'s [dataset finder](https://dataset-finder.netlify.app/), based on the extremely interesting [Data Is Plural project](https://www.data-is-plural.com/), has [a great example of the kind of UI you could create to make this interaction interesting and delightful](https://dataset-finder.netlify.app/random).

### Example wireframes

Your app does not have to look exactly like this. These wireframes are provided to give you an idea of how this might look, but you can be creative in your adaptation of this basic design.

#### When the application first loads

When the application loads, no category tab is selected yet. The jobs list should shows the latest jobs, not filtered by category. Or, if you have another idea for what you want to show before a user selects a category, go for it!

#### A list of jobs with React selected

When a user selects a category by clicking on the tab, that tab should be highlighted somehow to indicate that it has been selected. The jobs list should show only jobs in that category, listed displayed by title, company name and date listed.

#### One job selected

When a user clicks on a single job, the list is replaced with a detailed view of a single job. That view should include at least the job title, company name and logo (if available), job description, date listed, whether it is remote or not, and keywords associated with this listing. You should provide some way for the user to go back to the list of all jobs from here, such as [breadcrumb links](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/breadcrumb/) or just a link to go back to the list.

If you include a "go to listing" button, it can take the user to the job listing page on FindWork.dev using the URL provided by the API. The API does not include direct links to job applications.

## üå∂Ô∏è Spicy Options

- Make the keyword options in a job listing clickable. When a user clicks on one, your application should send a request to the API with that search keyword. BONUS: Add the new search to the navigation options and make sure these custom searches are available when the user loads the page again by storing them in local storage and making sure these custom tabs work the same as the hard coded ones.
- Provide additional sorting and filtering options. You can filter in the UI after fetching data or you can dig into the API and find other query params you could use to refine search results.
- Find a way to cache an API response so that you don't have to make the same exact API call multiple times in a row.
- Allow a user to bookmark job listings and save them using local storage. They should then be able to see a list of their bookmarked listings and delete listings they no longer want.
- The API returns many more job listings than can be shown on the page at one time. Implement some way to handle that large number of listings. You might allow your user to see paginated results or maybe you want to try to implement infinite scroll. However you do this, you will need to make multiple API calls using the paginated response from the API.
